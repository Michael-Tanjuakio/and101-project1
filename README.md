## Notes

I learned more about creating an app using XML.
Uploading the profile image to this project was tricky, my png link had dashes (-) and that wasn't allowed, I had to replaced it with an underscore to work.
I had a fun time finding what colors suit this app. I decided on light blue and a sandy color.
A good detail I did was changing the phone top bar to fit with the app.
I also needed to center the image, make the background color stretch to the card size horizontally.
And change the text size/color to make it look friendly.
Overall, this was a fun project to make and what I got out of this project was learning more about the XML textview process.
